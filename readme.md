    In problem 2, I put my solution in 'swap' folder, which also is a React project build by Create-react-app.
    To Run demo, you can clone this project, at terminal of 'swap' folder, please run below command:
    ```
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    Than visit [localhost port 3000](http://localhost:3000/).
