## 99 Tech coding challenge
# Frontend

**Note:**
    In problem 2, I put my solution in 'swap' folder, which also is a React project build by Create-react-app.
    To Run demo, you can clone this project, at terminal of 'swap' folder, please run below command:

    ```
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
Than visit [localhost port 3000](http://localhost:3000/). 

And for you easily to check the demo, i had already deploy it to Vercel. 
So you can simply visit [Demohere](https://99tech-demo.vercel.app) and test the product

Thank for your kind attention!
